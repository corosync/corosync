# In typical systemd deployments, both standard outputs are forwarded to
# journal (stderr is what's relevant in the pristine corosync configuration),
# which hazards a message redundancy since the syslog stream usually ends there
# as well; before editing this line, you may want to check DefaultStandardError
# in systemd-system.conf(5) and whether /dev/log is a systemd related symlink.
StandardError=null

# The following config is for corosync with enabled watchdog service.
#
#  When corosync watchdog service is being enabled and using with
#  pacemaker.service, and if you want to exert the watchdog when a
#  corosync process is terminated abnormally,
#  uncomment the line of the following Restart= and RestartSec=.
#Restart=on-failure
#  Specify a period longer than soft_margin as RestartSec.
#RestartSec=70
