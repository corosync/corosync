.SH NAME
.P
cmap_initialize \- Initialize CMAP API

.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fB#include <corosync/cmap.h>\fR

.P
\fBcs_error_t cmap_initialize (cmap_handle_t \fI*handle\fB);\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The \fBcmap_initialize\fR function is used to initialize a connection to
the Configuration Map API. Each application may have several connections to the CMAP API.
Each application uses the
.I handle
argument to uniquely identify the connection.  The
.I handle
argument is then used in other function calls to identify the connection to be used
for communication with the CMAP service.

.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR cmap_finalize (3),
.BR cmap_overview (8)
