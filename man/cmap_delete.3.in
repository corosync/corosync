.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fB#include <corosync/cmap.h>\fR

.P
\fBcs_error_t
cmap_delete(cmap_handle_t \fIhandle\fB, const char *\fIkey_name\fB);\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The
.B cmap_delete
function is used to delete key from cmap. Key must be previously created by
.B cmap_set(3)
function. The
.I handle
argument is connection to CMAP database obtained by calling
.B cmap_initialize(3)
function.
.I key_name
is name of key to delete.

.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful. If key_name is unspecified, CS_ERR_INVALID_PARAM
is returned. For nonexisting keys, CS_ERR_NOT_EXIST error is returned. Some of keys may be tagged
read-only directly in corosync and deleting such key will result in CS_ERR_ACCESS error.
