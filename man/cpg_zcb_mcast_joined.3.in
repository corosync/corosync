.SH NAME
cpg_mcast_joined \- Multicasts a zero copy buffer to all groups joined to a handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/uio.h>
.B #include <corosync/cpg.h>
.sp
.BI "int cpg_zcb_mcast_joined(cpg_handle_t " handle ", cpg_guarantee_t " guarantee ", const void *" buffer "", int " msg_len ");
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B cpg_zcb_mcast_joined
function will multicast a zero copy buffer message to all the processes that
have been joined with the
.B cpg_join(3)
function for the same group name.
Messages that are sent to any of the groups joined to the parameter
.I handle
will be delivered to all subscribed processes in the system.
.PP
The argument
.I guarantee
requests a delivery guarantee for the message to be sent.  The cpg_guarantee_t type is
defined by:
.IP
.RS
.ne 18
.nf
.ta 4n 30n 33n
typedef enum {
        CPG_TYPE_UNORDERED,     /* not implemented */
        CPG_TYPE_FIFO,          /* same as agreed */
        CPG_TYPE_AGREED,        /* implemented */
        CPG_TYPE_SAFE           /* not implemented */
} cpg_guarantee_t;

The meanings of the cpg_guarantee_t typedef are:
.TP
.B CPG_TYPE_UNORDERED
Messages are guaranteed to be delivered, but with no particular order.  This
mode is unimplemented in the CPG library.
.TP
.B CPG_TYPE_FIFO
Messages are guaranteed to be delivered in first sent first delivery order.
In fact, this guarantee is equivalent to the CPG_TYPE_AGREED guarantee.
.TP
.B CPG_TYPE_AGREED
All processors must agree on the order of delivery.  If a message is sent
from two or more processes at about the same time, the delivery will occur
in the same order to all processes.
.TP
.B CPG_TYPE_SAFE
All processes must agree on the order of delivery.  Further all processes
must have a copy of the message before any delivery takes place.  This mode is
unimplemented in the CPG library.
.PP
The
.I msg
argument describes the zero copy buffer which is used to transmit a message.
this buffer must be allocated by
.B cpg_zcb_alloc(3).

.PP
The
.I msg_len
argument describes the number of bytes to be transmitted in the zero copy buffer.

.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.
.PP
.SH ERRORS
The errors are undocumented.
