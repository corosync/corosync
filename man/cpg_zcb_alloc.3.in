.SH NAME
cpg_zcb_alloc \- Allocates a zero copy buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <corosync/cpg.h>
.sp
.BI "int cpg_zcb_alloc(cpg_handle_t " handle ", size_t " size ", void **" buffer ");
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B cpg_zcb_alloc
function will allocate a zero copy buffer for use with the
.B cpg_zcb_mcast_joined(3)
function.  This buffer should not be used in another thread while a
cpg_zcb_mcast_joined operation is taking place on the buffer.  The buffer is
allocated via operating system mechanisms to avoid copying in the IPC layer.

.PP
The argument
.I handle
describes the handle on which the buffer will be allocated.
.PP
The argument
.I size
requests a buffer of size be allocated.
.PP
The
.I buffer
argument is set to the buffer address that is allocated by this operation.

.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.
.PP
.SH ERRORS
The errors are undocumented.
