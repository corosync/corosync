.SH NAME
.P
cmap_keys \- Overview of keys stored in the Configuration Map

.SH OVERVIEW
.P
There are roughly 3 types of keys stored in CMAP:
.PP
* Mapping of values stored in config file.
.PP
* Runtime statistics.
.PP
* Other user created values.

In this man page, wild-cards are used with usual meaning.

.SH KEYS
.TP
internal_configuration.*
Internal configuration data. This keys (whole prefix) is read only.
It's only useful for getting list of loaded services.

.TP
logging.*
Values read from configuration file. It's possible to change them at runtime.
If subsystem specific configuration is needed, key must be in form
logging.logger_subsys.SERVICE.key, where SERVICE is upper case name of service and
key is same as in configuration file. All values are of string type.

.TP
nodelist.*
Values read from configuration file. Each node element in configuration file gets
assigned it's position starting from zero. So first node from config file has
nodelist.node.0. prefix. To be valid entry, each node must have
.B ring0_addr
key.
For change of
.B nodeid
key, use u32 data type.

Local node position is stored in
.B local_node_pos
key (RO), so it's easy to find
out nodeid/ring addresses of local node directly from cmap.

.TP
runtime.blackbox.*
Trigger keys for store fplay data. It's recommended to use corosync-blackbox command
to change keys in this prefix.

.TP
runtime.connections.*
There are informations about total number of active connections in given moment in
.B active
key, number of closed connections during whole runtime of corosync in
.B closed
key and informations about each active IPC connection. All keys in this prefix are read-only.

.TP
runtime.connections.ID.*
Each IPC connection has unique ID. This is in form [[short_name:][PID:]internal_id. On some
platforms, short_name and PID are not filled and only internal_id is used.

Typical keys in prefix are:

.B client_pid
containing PID of IPC connection (unavailable on some platforms).

.B dispatched
with number of dispatched messages.

.B invalid_request
is number of requests made by IPC which are invalid (calling non-existing call, ...).

.B name
containing short name of IPC connection (unavailable on some platforms).

.B overload
is number of requests which were not processed because of overload.

.B queue_size
contains number of messages in queue waiting for send.

.B recv_retries
is total number of interrupted receives.

.B requests
contains number of requests made by IPC.

.B responses
is number of responses sent to IPC client.

.B send_retries
contains total number of interrupted sends.

.B service_id
contains ID of service which IPC is connected to.

.TP
runtime.services.*
Prefix with statistics for service engines. Each service has it's own
.B service_id
key in prefix with name runtime.services.SERVICE., where SERVICE is lower case
name of service. Inside service prefix is number of received and send messages
by corosync engine in format runtime.services.SERVICE.EXEC_CALL.rx and
runtime.services.SERVICE.EXEC_CALL.tx, where EXEC_CALL is internal id of service
call (so for example 3 in cpg service is receive of multicast message from other
nodes).

.TP
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.*
Prefix with statistics about totem. All keys there are read only.
Typical key prefixes:

.B commit_entered
Number of times processor entered COMMIT state.

.B commit_token_lost
Number of times processor lost token in COMMIT state.

.B consensus_timeouts
How many times processor timeouted making consensus about membership.

.B continuous_gather
How many times was processor not able to reach consensus.

.B firewall_enabled_or_nic_failure
Set to 1 when processor was not able to reach consensus for long time. Usual
reason is badly configured firewall or connection failure.

.B gather_entered
Number of times processor entered GATHER state.

.B gather_token_lost
Number of times processor lost token in GATHER state.

.B mcast_retx
Number of retransmitted messages.

.B mcast_rx
Number of received multicast messages.

.B mcast_tx
Number of transmitted multicast messages.

.B memb_commit_token_rx
Number of received commit tokens.

.B memb_commit_token_tx
Number of transmitted commit tokens.

.B memb_join_rx
Number of received join messages.

.B memb_join_tx
Number of transmitted join messages.

.B memb_merge_detect_rx
Number of received member merge messages.

.B memb_merge_detect_tx
Number of transmitted member merge messages.

.B orf_token_rx
Number of received orf tokens.

.B orf_token_tx
Number of transmitted orf tokens.

.B recovery_entered
Number of times processor entered recovery.

.B recovery_token_lost
Number of times token was lost in recovery state.

.B rx_msg_dropped
Number of received messages which was dropped because they were not expected
(as example multicast message in commit state).

.B token_hold_cancel_rx
Number of received token hold cancel messages.

.B token_hold_cancel_tx
Number of transmitted token hold cancel messages.

.B mtt_rx_token
Mean transit time of token in milliseconds. In other words, time between
two consecutive token receives.

.B avg_token_workload
Average time in milliseconds of holding time of token on current processor.

.B avg_backlog_calc
Average number of not yet sent messages of current processor.

.TP
runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.*
Prefix containing members of totem single ring protocol. Each member
keys has format runtime.totem.pg.mrp.srp.members.NODEID.KEY, where key is
one of:

.B ip
IP address of member. It's stored in format r(RING_ID) ip(IP_ADDRESS).

.B join_count
Number of times processor joined membership with local processor. When
processor fails and rejoins again, this value is incremented.

.B status
Status of processor. Can be one of joined and left.

.B config_version
Config version of member node.

.TP
resources.process.PID.*
Prefix created by applications using SAM with CMAP integration.
It contains following keys:

.B recovery
Recovery policy of process. Can be one of quit or restart.

.B poll_period
Value passed in sam_initialize as time_interval.

.B last_updated
Last time when SAM received heartbeat from client.

.B state
State of client. Can be one of failed, stopped, running and waiting for quorum.

.TP
uidgid.*
Informations about users/groups which are allowed to do IPC connection to
corosync.

.TP
quorum.cancel_wait_for_all
Tells votequorum to cancel waiting for all nodes at cluster startup. Can be used
to unblock quorum if notes are known to be down. for pcs use only.

.TP
config.reload_in_progress
This value will be set to 1 (or created) when corosync.conf reload is started,
and set to 0 when the reload is completed. This allows interested subsystems
to do atomic reconfiguration rather than changing each key. Note that 
individual add/change/delete notifications will still be sent during a reload.

.TP
config.totemconfig_reload_in_progress
This key is similar to
.B config.totemconfig_reload_in_progress
but changed after totem config trigger is processed. It is useful (mainly)
for situations when
.B nodelist.local_node_pos
must be first correctly reinstated.

.SH DYNAMIC CHANGE USER/GROUP PERMISSION TO USE COROSYNC IPC
Is very same as in configuration file. To add UID 500 use

.br
# corosync-cmapctl -s uidgid.uid.500 u8 1

GID is similar, so to add GID use

.br
# corosync-cmapctl -s uidgid.gid.500 u8 1

For removal of permission, simply delete key

.br
# corosync-cmapctl -d uidgid.gid.500

.SH DYNAMIC ADD/REMOVE OF UDPU NODE
We will need to add node with address 10.34.38.108
and nodeid 3. This node is called NEW and it's not running corosync yet.

.PP
* Find a node position in node list which is not used yet. It's recommended to
use highest_number + 1. Let's say output of corosync-cmapctl looks like:

.br
nodelist.local_node_pos (u32) = 1
.br
nodelist.node.0.nodeid (u32) = 1
.br
nodelist.node.0.ring0_addr (str) = 10.34.38.106
.br
nodelist.node.1.nodeid (u32) = 2
.br
nodelist.node.1.ring0_addr (str) = 10.34.38.107

So next node position will be 2.
.PP
* Add all entries needed for node on all running nodes, as:

.br
# corosync-cmapctl -s nodelist.node.2.nodeid u32 3
.br
# corosync-cmapctl -s nodelist.node.2.ring0_addr str 10.34.38.108

Always add ring0_addr key as last. Corosync engine on all nodes should reply
with
.I notice  [TOTEM ] adding new UDPU member {10.34.38.108}
message.
.PP
* Add node information to configuration file on all nodes so it
will survive restart of corosync.
.PP
* Copy and edit configuration file to NEW node.
.PP
* Start corosync on NEW node.

Removal of UDPU node is very similar slightly reversed action, so
.PP
* Stop corosync old OLD node.
.PP
* Remove relevant entries from cmap on all nodes.
.PP
* Change configuration file on all nodes.
