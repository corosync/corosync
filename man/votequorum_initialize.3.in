.TH VOTEQUORUM_INITIALIZE 3 @BUILDDATE@ "corosync Man Page" "Corosync Cluster Engine Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
votequorum_initialize \- Create a new connection to the VoteQuorum service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <corosync/votequorum.h>
.sp
.BI "int votequorum_initialize(votequorum_handle_t *" handle ", votequorum_callbacks_t *" callbacks ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B votequorum_initialize
function is used to initialize a connection to the vote-based quorum database API.
.PP
Each application may have several connections to the votequorum API.  Each application
uses the
.I handle
argument to uniquely identify the connection.  The
.I handle
argument is then used in other function calls to identify the connection to be used
for communication with the votequorum service.
.PP
Every time the voting configuraton changes (eg a node joins or leave the cluster), the callback is called.
The callback function is described by the following type definitions:

.nf
typedef void (*votequorum_notification_fn_t) (
	votequorum_handle_t handle,
	uint64_t context,
	uint32_t quorate,
	uint32_t node_list_entries,
	votequorum_node_t node_list[]
	);

.fi

Current ring_id (one get in votequorum_notification_fn) must be passed to
.B votequorum_qdevice_poll
to make qdevice voting valid.

.PP
Every time the expected votes are changed, the callback is called.
The expected votes callback function is described by the following type definitions:

.nf
typedef void (*votequorum_expectedvotes_notification_fn_t) (
        votequorum_handle_t handle,
        uint64_t context,
        uint32_t expected_votes);
.fi
.PP
The
.I callbacks
argument is of the type:

.nf
typedef struct {
	votequorum_notification_fn_t votequorum_notify_fn;
	votequorum_expectedvotes_notification_fn_t votequorum_expectedvotes_notify_fn;
} votequorum_callbacks_t;
.fi
.PP
When a configuration change occurs, the callback
is called from the
.B votequorum_dispatch()
function.
.PP
.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.
