.TH COROSYNC-QDEVICE 8 2016-06-29
.SH NAME
corosync-qdevice \- QDevice daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "corosync-qdevice [-dfh] [-S option=value[,option2=value2,...]]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B corosync-qdevice
is a daemon running on each node of a cluster. It provides a configured
number of votes to the
quorum subsystem based on a third-party arbitrator's decision. Its primary use
is to allow a cluster to sustain more node failures than standard quorum rules allow. 
It is recommended for clusters with an even number of nodes and highly recommended 
for 2 node clusters.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -d
Forcefully turn on debug information without the need to change corosync.conf.
.TP
.B -f
Do not daemonize, run in the foreground.
.TP
.B -h
Show short help text
.TP
.B -S
Set advanced settings described in its own section below. This option
shouldn't be generally used because most of the options are
not safe to change.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.B corosync-qdevice
reads its configuration from corosync.conf file.

The main configuration is within
.B quorum.device
sub-key. Each model also has its own configuration within a
similarly named sub-key.
.TP
.B model
Specifies the model to be used. This parameter is required.
.B corosync-qdevice
is modular and is able to support multiple different models. The model basically
defines what type of arbitrator is used. Currently only
.I net
is supported.
.TP
.B timeout
Specifies how often
.B corosync-qdevice
should call the votequorum_poll function. It is also used by the net model to adjust
its hearbeat timeout. It is recommended that you don't change this value.
Default is 10000.
.TP
.B sync_timeout
Specifies how often
.B corosync-qdevice
should call the votequorum_poll function during a sync phase. It is recommended that you don't change this value.
Default is 30000.
.TP
.B votes
The number of votes provided to the cluster by qdevice. Default is (number_of_nodes - 1) or generally
sum(votes_per_node) - 1.
.PP
.B quorum.device.net
holds the configuration for model 'net'.
.TP
.B tls
Can be one of
.I on, off or required
and specifies if tls should be used.
.I on
means a connection with TLS is attempted first, but if the server doesn't advertise TLS support 
then non-TLS will be used.
.I off
is used then TLS is not required and it's then not even tried. This mode is the
only one which doesn't need a properly initialized NSS database.
.I required
means TLS is required and if the server doesn't support TLS, qdevice will
exit with error message. Default is on.
.TP
.B host
Specifies the IP address or host name of the qnetd server to be used. This parameter
is required.
.TP
.B port
Specifies TCP port of qnetd server. Default is 5403.
.TP
.B algorithm
Decision algorithm. Can be one of the
.I ffsplit
or
.I lms.
(actually there are also
.I test
and
.I 2nodelms
, both of which are mainly for developers and shouldn't be used for production clusters). For a 
description of what each algorithm means and how the algorithms differ see their individual sections.
Default value is ffsplit.
.TP
.B tie_breaker
can be one of
.I lowest,
.I highest
or valid_node_id (number) values. It's used as a fallback if qdevice has to decide between two or more
equal partitions.
.I lowest
means the partition with the lowest node id is chosen.
.I highest
means the partition with highest node id is chosen. And valid_node_id means that the partition
containing the node with the given node id is chosen.
Default is 'lowest'.
.TP
.B connect_timeout
Timeout when
.B corosync-qdevice
is trying to connect to
.B corosync-qnetd
host. Default is 0.8 * quorum.sync_timeout.
.TP
.B force_ip_version
can be one of
.I 0|4|6
and forces the software to use the given IP version.
.I 0
(default value) means IPv6 is prefered and IPv4 should be used as a fallback.

.PP
Logging configuration is within the
.B logging
directive.
.B corosync-qdevice
parses and supports most of the options with exception of
.B to_logfile,
.B logfile
and
.B logfile_priority.
The 
.B logger_subsys
sub-directive can be also used if
.B subsys
is set to QDEVICE.

.PP
For
.B corosync-qdevice
to work correctly, the
.B nodelist
directive has to be used and properly configured. Also the net model requires that
.B totem.cluster_name
option is set.

.SH MODEL NET TLS CONFIGURATION
For model net to work using TLS, it's necessary to create the NSS database, import Qnetd
CA certificate, and get/distribute a valid client certificate.

If pcs is used (recommended) the following steps are not needed because pcs does them automatically.

.B corosync-qdevice-net-certutil
is the tool to perform required actions semi-automatically. Please consult the help output of
it and its man page. For a first time configuration it may make sense to start with the
.B -Q
option.

If TLS is not required just edit corosync.conf file and set
.B quorum.device.net.tls
to
.I off.

.SH MODEL NET ALGORITHMS
Algorithms are used to change behavior of how
.B corosync-qnetd
provides votes to a given node/partition. Currently there are two algorithms supported.
.TP
.B ffsplit
This one makes sense only for clusters with even number of nodes. It provides exactly one
vote to the partition with the highest number of active nodes. If there are two exactly similar partitions,
it provides its vote to the partition that has the most clients connected to the qnetd
server. If this number is also equal, then the tie_breaker is used. It is able to transition
its vote if the currently active partition becomes partitioned and a non-active partition
still has at least 50% of the active nodes. Because of this, a vote is not provided
if the qnetd connection is not active.

To use this algorithm it's required to set the number of votes per node to 1 (default)
and the qdevice number of votes has to be also 1. This is achieved by setting
.B quorum.device.votes
key in corosync.conf file to 1.
.TP
.B lms
Last-man-standing. If the node is the only one left in the cluster that can see the
qnetd server then we return a vote.

If more than one node can see the qnetd server but some nodes can't
see each other then the cluster is divided up into 'partitions' based on
their ring_id and this algorithm returns a vote to the largest active partition or, 
if there is more than 1 equal partiton, the partition that contains the tie_breaker 
node (lowest, highest, etc). For LMS to work, the number
of qdevice votes has to be set to default (so just delete
.B quorum.device.votes
key from corosync.conf).
