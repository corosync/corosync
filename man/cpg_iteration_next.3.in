.SH NAME
.P
cpg_iteration_next \- Return next item in iteration of CPG

.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fB#include <corosync/cpg.h>\fR

.P
\fBcs_error_t
cpg_iteration_next (cpg_iteration_handle_t \fIhandle\fB, struct cpg_iteration_description_t *\fIdescription\fB);\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The
.B cpg_iter_next
function is used to get next value in iteration. The
.I handle
argument is iterator handle obtained by
.B cpg_iteration_initalize(3)
function.
.I description
is pointer to structure with following definition:
.IP
.RS
.ne 18
.nf
.PP
struct cpg_iteration_description_t {
    struct cpg_name group;
    uint32_t nodeid;
    uint32_t pid;
};
.ta
.fi
.RE
.IP
.PP

where \fBgroup\fR is name of group, \fBnodeid\fR is ID of connected node and \fBpid\fR is pid of
connected process. If iteration was initialized with \fBCPG_ITERATION_NAME_ONLY\fR iteration
type, both \fBnodeid\fR and \fBpid\fR are 0.

.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful. If there are no more items to iterate, CS_NO_SECTION
error code is returned.
