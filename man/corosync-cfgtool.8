.TH "COROSYNC-CFGTOOL" "8" "2020-02-10" "" ""
.SH "NAME"
corosync-cfgtool \- An administrative tool for corosync.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B corosync\-cfgtool [[\-i IP_address] [\-b] [\-s] [\-n] [\-R] [\-L] [\-k nodeid] [\-a nodeid] [\-h] [\-H]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B corosync\-cfgtool
A tool for displaying and configuring active parameters within corosync.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B -i
Finds only information about the specified interface IP address or link id with -s.
.TP 
.B -s
Displays the status of the current links on this node for UDP/UDPU, with extended status
for KNET.
After each link, the nodes on that link are displayed in order with their status,
for example there are 3 nodes with KNET transport:

LINK ID 0
        addr    = 192.168.100.80
        status:
                nodeid  1:      localhost
                nodeid  2:      connected
                nodeid  3:      connected
.TP
.B -b
Displays the brief status of the current links on this node (KNET only) when used
with "-s". If any interfaces are faulty, 1 is returned by the binary. If all interfaces
are active 0 is returned to the shell.
After each link, the nodes on that link are displayed in order with their status
encoded into a single digit, or characters 'n', 'd' and '?' with special meaning.
1=link enabled, 2=link connected, So a 3 in a node position indicates that the
link is both enabled and connected. Status represented by character 'n' is used for
localhost link. Character '?' means that Crosync was unable to get status of link from knet (log
should contain more information). Character 'd' shouldn't appear and it means that Corosync
was unable to configure a link and it is result of some error which should have been logged.

The output will be:

LINK ID 0
        addr    = 192.168.100.80
        status  = n33
.TP
.B -n
Displays the status of the current nodes in the system with their link status(es).
.P
.nf
Local node ID 1, transport knet
nodeid: 2 reachable   onwire (min/max/cur): 0, 1, 1
   LINK: 0 (192.168.1.101->192.168.1.102)  enabled connected
   LINK: 1 (192.168.4.1->192.168.4.2)  enabled
   LINK: 2 (192.168.9.1->192.168.9.2)  enabled
.fi
.P
Only reachable nodes are displayed so "reachable" should always be there.
.br
'onwire' versions are the knet on-wire versions that are supported/in use (where appropriate).
.br
IP addresses are the local and remote IP addresses (for UDP[U] only the local IP address is shown)
.br
enabled - means the link has been brought up
.br
connected - means that the link is connected to the remote node
.br
dynconnected - is not currently implemented

.TP
.B -R
Tell all instances of corosync in this cluster to reload corosync.conf.

Running corosync-cfgtool -R where nodes are running different versions
of corosync (including minor versions) is unsupported and may result in undefined
behaviour.
.TP
.B -L
Tell corosync to reopen all logging files. In contrast to other subcommands,
nothing is displayed on terminal if call is successful.
.TP
.B -k
Kill a node identified by node id.
.TP
.B -a
Display the IP address(es) of a node.
.TP
.B -h
Print basic usage.
.TP
.B -H
Shutdown corosync cleanly on this node.
