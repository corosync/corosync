.SH NAME
.P
sam_data_store \- Store user data

.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fB#include <corosync/sam.h>\fR

.P
\fBcs_error_t sam_data_store (const void *\fIdata\fB, size_t \fIsize\fB);\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The \fBsam_data_store\fR function is used to store data, which survives between
instances.

.P
The \fIdata\fR parameter is pointer to memory with data to store. Data
are stored in newly allocated memory inside library, so caller can safely remove
them after call of function.

You can use NULL as parameter to remove and free previously saved data. In this
case \fIsize\fR argument is ignored.

.P
The \fIsize\fR parameter is length of \fIdata\fR.

Use \fBsam_data_getsize(3)\fR to find out length of stored data and \fBsam_data_restore(3)\fR
to restore stored data.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.P
This call return CS_OK value if successful, otherwise and error is returned.

.SH ERRORS
.TP
CS_ERR_BAD_HANDLE
component was not initialized by calling \fBsam_initialize(3)\fR or it was finalized.
.TP
CS_ERR_NO_MEMORY
internal malloc/realloc failed because data are too large
.TP
CS_ERR_LIBRARY
some internal error appeared (mostly because communication with parent process failed)
