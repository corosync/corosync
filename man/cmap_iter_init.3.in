.SH NAME
.P
cmap_iter_init \- Initialize iterator for keys stored in CMAP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fB#include <corosync/cmap.h>\fR

.P
\fBcs_error_t
cmap_iter_init (cmap_handle_t \fIhandle\fB, const char *\fIprefix\fB, cmap_iter_handle_t *\fIcmap_iter_handle\fB);\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The
.B cmap_iter_init
function is used to initialize iteration of all keys with given
.I prefix.
The
.I handle
argument is connection to CMAP database obtained by calling
.B cmap_initialize(3)
function.
.I prefix
is string, and every returned key must have name with given prefix. This variable can also
be NULL (or empty string) and then all keys are iterated.

.B cmap_iter_init
is used only for initialize context for future
.B cmap_iter_next(3)
calls and handle needed for that function is returned in
.I cmap_iter_handle
variable. When you have finished iteration over objects, call
.B cmap_iter_finalize(3)
function to free up memory associated with iteration.

.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful. If there are no items with given prefixes,
CS_ERR_NO_SECTIONS is returned.
