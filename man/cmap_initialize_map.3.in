.SH NAME
.P
cmap_initialize_map \- Initialize CMAP API with a specific map

.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fB#include <corosync/cmap.h>\fR

.P
\fBcs_error_t cmap_initialize_map (cmap_handle_t \fI*handle\fB, cmap_map_t \fImap\fB);\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The \fBcmap_initialize_map\fR function is used to initialize a connection to
the Configuration Map API and specify a particular map to use. Each application may have
several connections to the CMAP API and to different maps.
Each application uses the
.I handle
argument to uniquely identify the connection.  The
.I handle
argument is then used in other function calls to identify the connection to be used
for communication with the CMAP service.
.P
The
.I map
argument specifies which map to connect to. \fICMAP_MAP_ICMAP\fB is the configuration map
that contains the current corosyn cconfiguraton and some runtime variables that maybe useful
to external agents. \fICMAP_MAP_STATS\fB is the statistics map that conains detailed information
about network and inter-process communications.


.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.
