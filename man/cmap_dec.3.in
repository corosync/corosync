.SH NAME
.P
cmap_inc \- Decrease already stored value in CMAP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fB#include <corosync/cmap.h>\fR

.P
\fBcs_error_t
cmap_dec (cmap_handle_t \fIhandle\fB, const char *\fIkey_name\fB);\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The
.B cmap_dec
function is used to decrease integer value of already stored key inside cmap. The
.I handle
argument is connection to CMAP database obtained by calling
.B cmap_initialize(3)
function.
.I key_name
is name of key to increase value of.

Function is defined only on values where increase makes sense and is well defined,
so it can be one of:
.PP
\fBCMAP_VALUETYPE_INT8\fR - 8-bit signed integer
.PP
\fBCMAP_VALUETYPE_UINT8\fR - 8-bit unsigned integer
.PP
\fBCMAP_VALUETYPE_INT16\fR - 16-bit signed integer
.PP
\fBCMAP_VALUETYPE_UINT16\fR - 16-bit unsigned integer
.PP
\fBCMAP_VALUETYPE_INT32\fR - 32-bit signed integer
.PP
\fBCMAP_VALUETYPE_UINT32\fR - 32-bit unsigned integer
.PP
\fBCMAP_VALUETYPE_INT64\fR - 64-bit signed integer
.PP
\fBCMAP_VALUETYPE_UINT64\fR - 64-bit unsigned integer

Overflow/underflow is not detected and it's ignored.

.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful. If value or key_name are unspecified, CS_ERR_INVALID_PARAM
is returned. CS_ERR_NOT_EXIST error is returned if key doesn't exist (wasn't created by calling
.B cmap_set(3)
first). Some of keys may be tagged read-only directly in corosync and setting such key will result in
CS_ERR_ACCESS error.
