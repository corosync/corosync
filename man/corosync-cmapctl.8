.SH NAME
corosync-cmapctl: \- A tool for accessing the object database.
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage:  corosync\-cmapctl [\-b] [\-dghsTtp] [params...]
.HP
\fB\-b\fR show binary values
.SS "Set key:"
.IP
corosync\-cmapctl \fB\-s\fR key_name type value
.IP
where type is one of ([i|u][8|16|32|64] | flt | dbl | str | bin)
for bin, value is file name (or \- for stdin)
.SS "Load settings from a file:"
.IP
corosync\-cmapctl \fB\-p\fR filename
.IP
the format of the file is:
[^[^]]<key_name>[ <type> <value>]
.IP
Keys prefixed with single caret ('^') are deleted (see \fB\-d\fR).
.IP
Keys (actually prefixes) prefixed with double caret ('^^') are deleted by prefix (see \fB\-D\fR).
.IP
<type> and <value> are optional (not checked) in above cases.
.IP
Other keys are set (see \fB\-s\fR) so both <type> and <value> are required.
.SS "Delete key:"
.IP
corosync\-cmapctl \fB\-d\fR key_name...
.SS "Delete multiple keys with prefix:"
.IP
corosync\-cmapctl \fB\-D\fR key_prefix...
.SS "Get key:"
.IP
corosync\-cmapctl [\-b] \fB\-g\fR key_name...
.SS "Display all keys:"
.IP
corosync\-cmapctl [\-b]
.SS "Display keys with prefix key_name:"
.IP
corosync\-cmapctl [\-b] key_name...
.SS "Track changes on keys with key_name:"
.IP
corosync\-cmapctl [\-b] \fB\-t\fR key_name
.SS "Track changes on keys with key prefix:"
.IP
corosync\-cmapctl [\-b] \fB\-T\fR key_prefix
