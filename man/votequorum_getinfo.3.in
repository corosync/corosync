.TH VOTEQUORUM_GETINFO 3 @BUILDDATE@ "corosync Man Page" "Corosync Cluster Engine Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
votequorum_getinfo \- Get information about the VoteQuorum service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <corosync/votequorum.h>
.sp
.BI "int votequorum_getinfo(votequorum_handle_t *" handle ", unsigned int " nodeid ", struct votequorum_info *" info ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B votequorum_getinfo
function is used to get information about the voting system and its nodes.

The
.I nodeid
argument indicates which node information should be stored in the votequorum_info structure.

The votequorum_info structure is defined as follows:

.nf

struct votequorum_info {
        unsigned int node_id;
        unsigned int node_state;
        unsigned int node_votes;
        unsigned int node_expected_votes;
        unsigned int highest_expected;
        unsigned int total_votes;
        unsigned int quorum;
        unsigned int flags;
        unsigned int qdevice_votes;
        char qdevice_name[VOTEQUORUM_QDEVICE_MAX_NAME_LEN];
};

.fi
The node_state is defined as:
.nf

#define VOTEQUORUM_NODESTATE_MEMBER     1
#define VOTEQUORUM_NODESTATE_DEAD       2
#define VOTEQUORUM_NODESTATE_LEAVING    3

.fi
The flags are defined as:
.nf

#define VOTEQUORUM_INFO_TWONODE                 1
#define VOTEQUORUM_INFO_QUORATE                 2
#define VOTEQUORUM_INFO_WAIT_FOR_ALL            4
#define VOTEQUORUM_INFO_LAST_MAN_STANDING       8
#define VOTEQUORUM_INFO_AUTO_TIE_BREAKER       16
#define VOTEQUORUM_INFO_ALLOW_DOWNSCALE        32
#define VOTEQUORUM_INFO_QDEVICE_REGISTERED     64
#define VOTEQUORUM_INFO_QDEVICE_ALIVE         128
#define VOTEQUORUM_INFO_QDEVICE_CAST_VOTE     256
#define VOTEQUORUM_INFO_QDEVICE_MASTER_WINS   512

.fi
.PP
The members starting node_ hold information specific to the requested nodeid, the other are
general to the voting system.
.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise a generic error is returned.
