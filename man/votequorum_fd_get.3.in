.TH VOTEQUORUM_FD_GET 3 @BUILDDATE@ "corosync Man Page" "Corosync Cluster Engine Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
votequorum_fd_get \- Dispatches callbacks from the votequorum service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <corosync/votequorum.h>
.sp
.BI "int votequorum_fd_get(votequorum_handle_t " handle ", int *" fd ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B votequorum_fd_get
function is used to retrieve the file descriptor that may be used with the poll
system call to determine when
.B votequorum_dispatch(3)
won't block.  The
.I handle
argument may not be used directly with
.B poll
because it is not the file descriptor, but instead an internal identifier used
by the votequorum library.
.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.
