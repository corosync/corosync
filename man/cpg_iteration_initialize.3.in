.SH NAME
.P
cpg_iteration_initialize \- Initialize iterator for members of CPG

.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fB#include <corosync/cpg.h>\fR

.P
\fBcs_error_t
cpg_iteration_initialize (cpg_handle_t \fIhandle\fB, cpg_iteration_type_t \fIiteration_type\fB,
const struct cpg_name *\fIgroup\fB, cpg_iteration_handle_t *\fIcpg_iteration_handle\fB);\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The
.B cpg_iteration_initialize
function is used to initialize iteration of CPG members.
The
.I handle
argument is connection to CPG database obtained by calling
.B cpg_initialize(3)
function.
.I iteration_type
is used for limit number of returned items and can be one of:
.PP
\fBCPG_ITERATION_NAME_ONLY\fR - only name of used groups are returned
.PP
\fBCPG_ITERATION_ONE_GROUP\fR - only members group with name \fIgroup\fR are returned
.PP
\fBCPG_ITERATION_ALL\fR - all members are returned

The
.I group
parameter is used only with \fBCPG_ITERATION_ONE_GROUP\fR and it's name of group with
members to iterate. For other \fIiteration_type\fR, this parameter must be NULL.

.B cpg_iteration_initialize
is used only for initialize context for future
.B cpg_iteration_next(3)
calls and handle needed for that function is returned in
.I cpg_iteration_handle
variable. When you have finished iteration over objects, call
.B cpg_iteration_finalize(3)
function to free up memory associated with iteration.

.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful. If \fIcpg_iteration_handle\fR is NULL,
\fBCS_ERR_INVALID_PARAM\fR error is returned. Same error is returned when \fIiteration_type\fR
is \fBCPG_ITERATION_ONE_GROUP\fR, but \fIgroup\fR is NULL, or when \fIgroup\fR is not NULL and
\fIiteration_type\fR is not \fBCPG_ITERATION_ONE_GROUP\fR. If there is not enough memory
for internal store of data, \fBCS_ERR_NO_MEMORY\fR is returned. \fBCS_ERR_BAD_HANDLE\fR can
be returned, if \fIhandle\fR is not valid handle.
