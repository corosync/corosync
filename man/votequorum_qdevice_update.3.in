.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B votequorum_qdevice_update
is used to change the name of the quorum device to corosync. The name of q quorum device is purely informational

to reflect the actual device contributing votes to quorum to avoid user confusion.
.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.
