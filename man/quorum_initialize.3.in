.TH QUORUM_INITIALIZE 3 @BUILDDATE@ "corosync Man Page" "Corosync Cluster Engine Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
quorum_initialize \- Create a new connection to the Quorum service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <corosync/quorum.h>
.sp
.BI "int quorum_initialize(quorum_handle_t *" handle ", quorum_callbacks_t *" callbacks ", uint32_t *" quorum_type ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B quorum_initialize
function is used to initialize a connection to the quorum API.
.PP
Each application may have several connections to the quorum API.  Each application
uses the
.I handle
argument to uniquely identify the connection.  The
.I handle
argument is then used in other function calls to identify the connection to be used
for communication with the quorum service.
.PP
Every time the voting configuraton changes (eg a node joins or leave the cluster) or the quorum status change,
the callback is called.
The callback function is described by the following type definitions:

.nf
typedef void (*quorum_notification_fn_t) (
        quorum_handle_t handle,
        uint32_t quorate,
        uint64_t ring_seq,
        uint32_t view_list_entries,
        uint32_t *view_list
        );
.fi
.PP
The
.I callbacks
argument is of the type:

.nf
typedef struct {
        quorum_notification_fn_t quorum_notify_fn;
} quorum_callbacks_t;
.fi
.PP
The
.I quorum_type
argument is set to:

.nf
#define QUORUM_FREE     0
#define QUORUM_SET      1
.fi
.PP
.I QUORUM_FREE
value means that no quorum algorithm is loaded and that no callbacks will take place.
.PP
.I QUORUM_SET
value means that one quorum algorithm is configured and that callbacks will take place.
.PP
When a configuration change occurs, the callback
is called from the
.B quorum_dispatch()
function.
.PP
.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.
