.TH QUORUM_FD_GET 3 @BUILDDATE@ "corosync Man Page" "Corosync Cluster Engine Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
quorum_fd_get \- Dispatches callbacks from the quorum service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <corosync/quorum.h>
.sp
.BI "int quorum_fd_get(quorum_handle_t " handle ", int *" fd ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B quorum_fd_get
function is used to retrieve the file descriptor that may be used with the poll
system call to determine when
.B quorum_dispatch(3)
won't block.  The
.I handle
argument may not be used directly with
.B poll
because it is not the file descriptor, but instead an internal identifier used
by the quorum library.
.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.
