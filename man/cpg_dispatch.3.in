.SH NAME
cpg_dispatch \- Dispatches callbacks from the CPG service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <corosync/cpg.h>
.sp
.BI "int cpg_dispatch(cpg_handle_t " handle ", cpg_dispatch_t *" dispatch_types ");
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B cpg_dispatch
function is used to dispatch configuration changes or messages from the
closed process groups API.
.PP
Each application may have several connections to the CPG API.  Each application
uses the
.I handle
argument to uniquely identify the connection.
.PP
The
.I dispatch_types
argument is used to identify the type of dispatch to execute.  The possible types are
defined by the structure:

.IP
.RS
.ne 18
.nf
.ta 4n 30n 33n
typedef enum {
        CS_DISPATCH_ONE,
        CS_DISPATCH_ALL,
        CS_DISPATCH_BLOCKING
} cpg_dispatch_t;
.ta
.fi
.RE
.IP
.PP
.PP
The dispatch values have the following meanings:
.TP
.B CS_DISPATCH_ONE
Dispatch atleast one callback, blocking until the callback is dispatched.
.TP
.B CS_DISPATCH_ALL
Dispatch all waiting callbacks without blocking to wait for any callbacks.
.TP
.B CS_DISPATCH_BLOCKING
Dispatch all callbacks, blocking indefinitely.  This is used in a threaded
program where a thread is created, and then cpg_dispatch() is called immediately
from the created thread to execute callbacks.
.TP
.B CS_DISPATCH_ONE_NONBLOCKING
Dispatch at most one callback. If there is no pending callback,
CS_ERR_TRY_AGAIN is returned.

.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CS_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.
.PP
.SH ERRORS
The errors are undocumented.
