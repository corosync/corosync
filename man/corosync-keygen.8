.TH COROSYNC-KEYGEN 8 2010-05-30
.SH NAME
corosync-keygen \- Generate an authentication key for Corosync.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "corosync-keygen [\-k <filename>] [\-l]"
.SH DESCRIPTION

If you want to configure corosync to use cryptographic techniques to ensure authenticity
and privacy of the messages, you will need to generate a private key.
.PP
.B corosync-keygen
creates this key and writes it to /etc/corosync/authkey or to file specified by
-k option.
.PP
This private key must be copied to every processor in the cluster.  If the
private key isn't the same for every node, those nodes with nonmatching private
keys will not be able to join the same configuration.
.PP
Copy the key to some security transportable storage or use ssh to transmit the
key from node to node.  Then install the key with the command:
.PP
unix#: install -D --group=0 --owner=0 --mode=0400 /path_to_authkey/authkey /etc/corosync/authkey
.PP
If a message "Invalid digest" appears from the corosync executive, the keys
are not consistent between processors.
.PP
.B Note: corosync-keygen
will ask for user input to assist in generating entropy unless the -l option is used.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -k <filename>
This specifies the fully qualified path to the shared key to create.
.br
The default is /etc/corosync/authkey.
.TP
.B -l
Use a less secure random data source that will not require user input to help generate
entropy.  This may be useful when this utility is used from a script or hardware random number
generator is not available (f.e. in virtual machine).

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Generate the key.
.PP
# corosync-keygen
.br
Corosync Cluster Engine Authentication key generator.
.br
Gathering 1024 bits for key from /dev/random.
.br
Press keys on your keyboard to generate entropy.
.br
.PP
$ corosync-keygen -l -k /tmp/authkey
.br
Corosync Cluster Engine Authentication key generator.
.br
Writing corosync key to /tmp/authkey.
