.TH COROSYNC-KEYGEN 8 2019-04-09
.SH NAME
corosync-keygen \- Generate an authentication key for Corosync.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "corosync-keygen [\-k <filename>]  [-m <randomfile>] [\-s size] [\-l] [\-h]"
.SH DESCRIPTION

If you want to configure corosync to use cryptographic techniques to ensure authenticity
and privacy of the messages, you will need to generate a private key.
.PP
.B corosync-keygen
creates this key and writes it to /etc/corosync/authkey or to file specified by
-k option.
.PP
This private key must be copied to every processor in the cluster.  If the
private key isn't the same for every node, those nodes with nonmatching private
keys will not be able to join the same configuration.
.PP
Copy the key to some security transportable storage or use ssh to transmit the
key from node to node.  Then install the key with the command:
.PP
unix#: install -D --group=0 --owner=0 --mode=0400 /path_to_authkey/authkey /etc/corosync/authkey
.PP
If a message "Invalid digest" appears from the corosync executive, the keys
are not consistent between processors.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -k <filename>
This specifies the fully qualified path to the shared key to create.
.br
The default is /etc/corosync/authkey.
.TP
.B -r
Random number source file. Default is /dev/urandom. As an example /dev/random may be
used when really superb randomness is needed.
.TP
.B -s size
Size of the generated key in bytes. Default is 256 bytes. Allowed range is <128, 4096>.
.TP
.TP
.B -l
Option is not used and it's kept only for compatibility.
.TP
.B -h
Print basic usage.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Generate the key.
.nf
# corosync-keygen
Corosync Cluster Engine Authentication key generator.
Gathering 2048 bits for key from /dev/urandom.
Writing corosync key to /etc/corosync/authkey
.fi

.TP
Generate longer key and store it in the /tmp/authkey file.
.nf
$ corosync-keygen -s 2048 -k /tmp/authkey
Corosync Cluster Engine Authentication key generator.
Gathering 16384 bits for key from /dev/urandom.
Writing corosync key to /tmp/authkey.
.fi

.TP
Generate superb key using /dev/random
.nf
# corosync-keygen -r /dev/random
Gathering 2048 bits for key from /dev/random.
