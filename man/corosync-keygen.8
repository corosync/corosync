.TH COROSYNC-KEYGEN 8 2010-05-30
.SH NAME
corosync-keygen \- Generate an authentication key for Corosync.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "corosync-keygen"
.SH DESCRIPTION

If you want to configure corosync to use cryptographic techniques to ensure authenticity
.br
and privacy of the messages, you will need to generate a private key.
.PP
.B corosync-keygen
creates this key and writes it to /etc/corosync/authkey.
.PP
This private key must be copied to every processor in the cluster.  If the
.br
private key isn't the same for every node, those nodes with nonmatching private
.br
keys will not be able to join the same configuration.
.PP
Copy the key to some security transportable storage or use ssh to transmit the
.br
key from node to node.  Then install the key with the command:
.PP
unix#: install -D --group=0 --owner=0 --mode=0400 /path_to_authkey/authkey /etc/corosync/authkey
.PP
If a message "Invalid digest" appears from the corosync executive, the keys
.br
are not consistent between processors.
.PP
.B Note: corosync-keygen
will ask for user input to assist in generating entropy.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Generate the key.
.PP
$ corosync-keygen
.br
Corosync Cluster Engine Authentication key generator.
.br
Gathering 1024 bits for key from /dev/random.
.br
Press keys on your keyboard to generate entropy.
