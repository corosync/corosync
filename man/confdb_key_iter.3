.TH CONFDB_KEY_ITER 3 2008-04-17 "corosync Man Page" "Corosync Cluster Engine Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
confdb_key_iter \- Iterate through key/value pairs in the Configuration Database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <corosync/confdb.h>
.sp
.BI "confdb_error_t confdb_key_iter_start(confdb_handle_t " handle ", unsigned int " parent_object_handle " ); "
.sp
.BI "confdb_error_t confdb_key_iter(confdb_handle_t " handle ", unsigned int " parent_object_handle ", void " *key_name ", int " *key_name_len ",  void " *value ", int " *value_len " ); "

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B confdb_key_iter
function repeatedly returns all key/value pairs that are subobjects of the specified parent. You must call
.B confdb_key_iter_start
first. This establishes a context for the parent object so that it knows where you are in the list. Then the next call to
.B confdb_key_iter
will return the first key/value in the list. Subsequent calls will return any remaining keys. The function returns CONFDB_ERR_ACCESS when the all of the matching keys have been seen.
.BR
The library holds a seperate context for each parent object, so you can call confdb_key_iter() on several parent objects at the same time and they will not interfere. Nor will they interfere with
.B confdb_object_find
or
.B confdb_object_iter
calls on the same parent object.
.BR
.SH RETURN VALUE
This call returns the CONFDB_OK value if successful, otherwise an error is returned.
.PP
.SH ERRORS
The errors are undocumented.
