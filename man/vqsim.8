.SH NAME
vqsim \- The votequorum simulator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "vqsim [\-c config_file] [\-o output file] [\-n] [\-h]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vqsim
simulates the quorum functions of corosync in a single program. it can simulate
multiple nodes, network splits and a basic quorum device.

By default vqsim will build a virtual cluster of all the nodes in the corosync.conf file, 
each 'node' running in a forked subprocess (and thus asynchronously). It then provides a
command-line interface to add (up) or remove (down) nodes, and cause network splits and 
rejoins. After each event it shows the new quorum status for all nodes.

Nodes in vqsim are always referred to by their nodeid (the IP address is meaningless) and
optionally by a 'partition' which precedes the nodeid with a colon. By default all nodes
are in partion 0. Nodes can be moved between partions using the split and join commands.
Multiple nodes can be split and joined at the same time.

To script vqsim you must send input to it via a pipe rather than just redirecting STDIN. This
is because it runs asynchronously to enable the virtual 'nodes' to report status when needed. 
(eg if you kill a subprocess using the 'kill(1)' command it gets removed from the cluster). 
There is a 'sleep' command to make vqsim to pause input after executing scripted commands to
allow 'nodes' to process.

The number of votes per node is read from corosync.conf. New nodes added using the 'up' command
will copy their number of votes from the first node in corosync.conf. This may not be what you
expect and I might fix it in future. As most clusters have only 1 vote per node (and this is
strongly recommended) then this should rarely be a problem.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c
This specifies the fully qualified path to the corosync configuration file.

The default is /etc/corosync/corosync.conf.
.TP
.B -o
Specifies the output destination. STDOUT by default.
.TP
.B -n
Don't pause until new nodes have been added. The default is to suspend input
until new nodes have joined a partition.
.TP
.B -h
Display a brief help message
