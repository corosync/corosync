 The Corosync Cluster Engine Topic Branches and Backlog
--------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------
 Last Updated: October 2011
----------------------------

--------------------------------------
 Current priority list for Needle 2.0
--------------------------------------
1. quorum debugging and rework
2. remove external plug-in api
3. remove logsys.h from external headers
4. allow a cluster name to autogenerate a mcastaddr
5. ring status change via corosync-notifyd

--------------------------------------
 Current priority list for Needle 2.1
--------------------------------------
1. implement topic-onecrypt
2. implement add/remove nodes from udpu
3. logsys glue layer removal
4. implement topic-zerocopy
5. implement topic-rdmaud
6. harden and finish ykd algorithm
7. implement topic-xmlschema

We use topic branches in our git repository to develop new disruptive features
that define our future roadmap.  This file describes the topic branches
the developers have interest in investigating further.

targets can be: whitetank, needle2.0, needle3.0, or future (3.0+).
Finished can be: percentage or date merged to master.  Once in a shipped
version, please remove from the topic list.

topic-xmlschema
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Developer: Honza Friesse
Started: not started
Finished: 0%
target: needle2.1
XML configuration for corosync exists, but imput file is not checked against
XML schema. This topic is about implementing preferably RelaxNG schema of
corosync configuration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
topic-onecrypt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Developer: Honza Friesse
Started: not started
Finished: 0%
target: needle2.1
Description:
Currently encryption code is located in totemudp.c, totemudpu.c, and iba has
no encryption support.  This topic merges the encryption code into a new
file such as totemcrp.c and provides a mechanism for totemnet.c to register
encrypt and decrypt functions with totem[udp|iba|udpu] and use them as
requested by the configuration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
topic-netmalloc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Developer: Honza Friesse
Started: not started
Finished: 0%
target: needle2.1
Description:
The totemiba.c driver must allocate memory and assign it to a protection domain
in order for an infiniband driver to transmit memory.  In the current
implementation, totemsrp.c also allocates these same frames.  This results in
an extra memcpy when transmitting with libibverbs technology.  Memory copies
are to be avoided.  The simple solution is to have each network driver provide
a memory allocation function.  When totemsrp wants a free frame, it requests
it from the network driver.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
topic-rdmaud
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Developer: Honza Friesse Steven Dake
Started: not started
Finished: 0%
target: needle2.1
Description:
Currently our RDMA code uses librdmacm to setup connections.  We are not 
certain this extra library is needed, and may be able to use only ibverbs.  If
this is possible, the totem code may be more reliable, especially around
failure conditions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
topic-zerocopy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Developer: Honza Friesse
Started: not started
Finished: 0%
target: needle2.1
Description:
Totem has many copies involved in messaging which we would like to investigate
removing.  Our goal is to deliver wire speed performance for rdma networks,
and if this can be achieved by our other topic investigations, we may not
further investigate this topic.  The basic idea of the topic is to handle
message assembly/fragmentation in libcpg, and have totem be responsible for
sending these pages that are shared via posix shared memory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
other topics not yet defined:
* disallow binding to localhost interfae in redundant ring configuation.
* doxygenize include and lib directories.
* sort out binding to localhost in general
* totem multiring
* load balancing over different speed links in RRP
