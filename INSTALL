* Building from git *
---------------------
When building and installing from git, autoconf 2.61, automake 1.11,
libtool 2.2.6 and pkgconfig 0.23  (or later versions) are required.
Prior versions may result in build failures.

Step 1: check out a read only copy of the repository
git clone git://github.com/corosync/corosync.git

Find the version you want to build.  Usually this will be the "master" version.
If you want to build a specific released version, use git checkout VERSION.

Step 2: Generate the makefiles
balance:~/corosync% ./autogen.sh

Step 3: Run the configure script
balance:~/corosync% ./configure

Step 4: Install the binaries
balance:~/corosync% su
balance:~/corosync# make install

-------------------------
* Building from tarball *
-------------------------
The tarball is distributed with pregenerated makefiles.  There is no need
to run the autogen.sh script in this case.

Step 1: Run the configure script
balance:~/corosync% ./configure

Step 2: Install the binaries
balance:~/corosync% su
balance:~/corosync# make install

-------------------------------
* A notice about dependencies *
-------------------------------
We have strived very hard to avoid dependencies as much as possible, but there
are two required libraries: LibQB (https://github.com/ClusterLabs/libqb)
and KNET (https://kronosnet.org/).

Optional dependencies are support for DBUS, SNMP and libstatgrab.

Also don't forget to install pkgconfig.

-----------------------------------------
* Building with SNMP/DBUS support *
-----------------------------------------

You can get SNMP traps on the following corosync events:
1) node joine/leave
2) application connect/dissconnect from corosync
3) quorum gain/lost

There are 2 modes of achieving this DBUS + foghorn and snmp-agentx.

Setting up to get dbus events.
------------------------------
foghorn (http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/foghorn.git) converts
dbus signals into snmp traps. So install foghorn.

$ ./configure --enable-dbus
$ make && sudo make install
$ /etc/init.d/corosync start
$ echo "OPTIONS=\"-d\"" > /etc/sysconfig/corosync-notifyd
$ /etc/init.d/corosync-notifyd start
Start foghorn

to see the dbus signals getting sent try:
$ dbus-monitor --system

Setting up snmp-agentx.
-----------------------
If you don't want to use dbus then you can use snmp-agentx.

$ ./configure --enable-snmp
$ make && sudo make install
$ /etc/init.d/corosync start
$ vim /etc/snmp/snmptrapd.conf

Add the following:
authCommunity   log,execute,net public
$ /etc/init.d/snmptrapd start
$ echo "OPTIONS=\"-s\"" > /etc/sysconfig/corosync-notifyd
$ /etc/init.d/corosync-notifyd start

I start up wireshark to see if there are any snmp traps been sent
as I am too lazy to setup a manager to receive traps.

run a program that talks to corosync e.g.
$ corosync-cmapctl

And you should get traps


------------------------
* Configuring Corosync *
------------------------
The configuration directory (usually /etc/corosync) contains an example
configuration file (corosync.conf.example). Please copy it as corosync.conf
and edit it as needed. At the very minimum, the nodelist section will have to be changed
to list all cluster nodes. For more information about the configuration file
please read the corosync.conf.5 manual page.

Generate a private key
----------------------
corosync uses cryptographic techniques to ensure authenticity and privacy of
messages.  A private key must be generated and shared by all processors for
correct operation.

First generate the key on one of the nodes:

balance# corosync-keygen
Corosync Authentication key generator.
Gathering 8192 bits for key from /dev/random.
Writing corosync key to /etc/corosync/authkey.

After this is complete, a private key will be in the file /etc/corosync/authkey.
This private key must be copied to every processor that will be a member of
the cluster.  If the private key isn't the same for every node, those nodes
with nonmatching private keys will not be able to join the same configuration.

Copy the key to some transportable storage or use ssh to transmit the key
from node to node.  Then install the key with the command:

balance# install -D --group=0 --owner=0 --mode=0400 /path_to_authkey/authkey /etc/corosync/authkey

If the message invalid digest appears, the keys are not the same on each node.

Run the corosync executive
-------------------------
Get one or more nodes and run the corosync executive on each node.  Run the
corosync daemon after following the previous directions.  The daemon must be
run as UID 0(root).

Before running any of the test programs
---------------------------------------
The corosync executive will ensure security by only allowing the UID 0(root) or
GID 0(root) to connect to it.  To allow other users to access the corosync
executive, create a directory called /etc/corosync/uidgid.d and place a file in
it named in some way that is identifiable to you.  All files in this directory
will be scanned and their contents added to the allowed uid gid database.  The
contents of this file should be
uidgid {
	uid: username
	gid: groupname
}

Please note that these users then have full ability to transmit and receive
messages in the cluster.

Try out the corosync cpg functionality
--------------------------------------
After corosync is running

Run test/testcpg on multiple nodes or on the same node.  Messages can be typed
which will then be sent to other testcpg applications in the cluster.

To see a hashed verified output of data on all nodes, test/cpgverify can be
run.
