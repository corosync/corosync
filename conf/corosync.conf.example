		# However, if you have multiple physical network
		# interfaces configured for the same subnet, then the
		# network address alone is not sufficient to identify
		# the interface Corosync should bind to. In that case,
		# configure the *host* address of the interface
		# instead:
		# bindnetaddr: 192.168.1.1
		# When selecting a multicast address, consider RFC
		# 2365 (which, among other things, specifies that
		# 239.255.x.x addresses are left to the discretion of
		# the network administrator). Do not reuse multicast
		# addresses across multiple Corosync clusters sharing
		# the same network.
		mcastaddr: 239.255.1.1
		# Corosync uses the port you specify here for UDP
		# messaging, and also the immediately preceding
		# port. Thus if you set this to 5405, Corosync sends
		# messages from UDP port 5404 to UDP port 5405.
		mcastport: 5405
		# Time-to-live for cluster communication packets. The
