# This logrotate method has two main problems and it's kept only for reference:
# 1. It does fail when corosync is not running (solvable by adding "|| true")
# 2. If (for some reason) cfgtool -L fails, logrotate fails and corosync keeps
#    logging into old file. Added "|| true" makes situation even worse
#    because logrotate removes file but corosync keeps logging into it.
